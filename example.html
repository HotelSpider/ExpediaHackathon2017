The d残or is very eclectic, comfortable and fully catered as a liveable apartment. Plus there is no need to worry about enough power points to charge you devices as there are power points everywhere (with adapters supplied).\nThe stairs are exactly as described and merely act as training for the rest of Paris. You climb everywhere in Paris! And as other guests stated, the views are breathtaking. We failed to find a better view of the Eiffel Tower on our trip.\nKaren has high but reasonable expectations regarding the cleanliness of the apartment and we were happy to pay the ﾛ50 to make the most of our holiday time. A lot of thought has gone into this apartment and I cannot recommend it highly enough!",

There are spare adapter plugs,  wireless speakers, a nespresso, and even a scale to weigh your bags before going to the airport.  These little things make for a big difference in how easy and comfortable it feels. \n\nThe stairs DO suck-  but it's worth it.  Even if you're tired at the end.  We paid the cleaning fee of 50ﾛ which was well worth it. \n\nKaren was super helpful.  Her instructions made check in super easy.  Also,  as I work,  I really appreciated that the wifi was of really good quality-  Something that can really be lacking.  \n\nOn our next trip,  we will definitely stay here.  In a word-  incredible.

There are two small balconies that are good for standing. The bathroom, kitchen, supplies, cleanliness, and decor were all very good. The walk up the 124 stairs to the 7th floor (US numbering system) would be difficult with lots of luggage or weak legs, but there are few apartments in the tower so there was lots of privacy (we only saw one other person on the stairs during our week stay). The stairs themselves are solid, but there was some peeling paint and some loose tiles. The location was great for walks, (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Champs de Mars, Trocadero, alone the Seine) and within 5-10 minutes of Iena, Trocadero, Alma-Marceau, and Pont de l'Alma Metro stops.

But- worth it. The photos were EXACTLY what it looked like when we arrived. My husband raved about the view every night we retired to the chairs with tea and watched the tower sparkle. The location is great- we felt very safe. My husband and I walked everywhere and we spent most of our time in other arrondissements so we were a little further from them. I'd suggest getting to know the Metro system if you have a lot of ground to cover in a short time. Since you are restocking the items you use- I'd suggest packing an extra roll of toilet paper or 2- and then you don't even have to worry about getting to the supermarket. Convenient to have plates/mugs and a fridge & microwave to keep snacks and warm them up.",

It is close to a metro stop for easy access to other points in the city, but Uber was also very convenient for getting to areas requiring a connecting stop a little faster.  There is a stocked kitchen for cooking through we didn't use it.  There is a washer, but no dryer so you can lighten up the packing for a longer stay.  Everything was clean and exactly as described. As noted, it is a 6th story walk up, but the effort is worth the view.",
